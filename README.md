# calculator
TOP Calculator project with plain JS, CSS &amp; HTML

The plan:  
- create a centered calculator  
- use CSS Grid this time  
- have 4 operators, a decimal, clear, delete, equals buttons  
- have the calculator only evaluate 2 operands at one time  
    - if more are added then first evaluate the previous two

What I managed:  
- created a layout, styled and positioned WAY faster than ever before    
- combined CSS Grid and Flexbox  
- kept the stylesheet ordered -> class selectors used almost always  
- kept JS under 200 lines using an object - no constructors or classes, just an object literal  
- added keyboard support  

Updates:  
- TBA

Takeaways:  
It was a fun little project, I surprised myself with how "quick" I managed the HTML and CSS part. JS was trickier and I basically overthought a lot, wasting time. Not really a waste since I learned from it but using pseudocode and a sketch is really helpful.  
Also managed to add keyboard support with relative ease.  
I could've done it with class constructors and data-sets but I wanted to stick to the course and train on the more basic ways. The code could be WAY cleaner but I think I'm going to keep it as is to remember the flaws.
