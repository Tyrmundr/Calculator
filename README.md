# calculator
TOP Calculator project with plain JS, CSS &amp; HTML

The plan:  
- create a centered calculator  
- use CSS Grid this time  
- have 4 operators, a decimal, clear, delete, equals buttons  
- have the calculator only evaluate 2 operands at one time  
    - if more are added then first evaluate the previous two
